ISTT is an application that connects Shippo’s API to IFTTT’s [Maker Channel](https://ifttt.com/maker) to allow the user to choose the best way of receiving notifications about his package.

Make sure you visit the web application ([ISTT.vai.la](http://istt.vai.la)) to set your ISTT. It will take less than a minute.

Once it's set up you can create any Recipe you want in IFTTT using the Maker Channel as Trigger. Just make sure the event name is the same you set up in ISTT.

Our solution is composed by a web application and a node.js [WebTask](https://webtask.io/) REST Service. Both access a mongo database to get user data.
