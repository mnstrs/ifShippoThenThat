Hackaton at DevWeek San Francisco

ISTT is an application that connects Shippo’s API to IFTTT’s [Maker Channel](https://ifttt.com/maker) to allow the user to choose the best way of receiving notifications about his package.

Make sure you visit the web application ([ISTT.vai.la](http://istt.vai.la)) to get set your ISTT. It will take less than a minute.

Our solution is composed by a web application and a node.js [WebTask](https://webtask.io/) REST Service.
